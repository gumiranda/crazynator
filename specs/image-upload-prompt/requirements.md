# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to upload images directly in their prompts, allowing the AI agent to interpret and analyze visual content such as screenshots, diagrams, code snippets, UI mockups, and other images. The system will use Cloudflare R2 for secure and efficient image storage, providing a seamless multimodal experience where users can combine text and visual inputs for more comprehensive AI assistance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload images in my prompts, so that I can get AI assistance with visual content like screenshots, diagrams, or UI mockups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the prompt input area THEN the system SHALL display an image upload option (button or drag-and-drop zone)
2. WHEN a user selects an image file THEN the system SHALL validate the file type and size before upload
3. WHEN an image is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the image in the prompt area
4. WHEN a user submits a prompt with an image THEN the system SHALL send both text and image data to the AI agent
5. IF an image upload fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to drag and drop images directly into the prompt area, so that I can quickly add visual context without clicking through file dialogs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags an image file over the prompt area THEN the system SHALL highlight the drop zone
2. WHEN a user drops an image file in the prompt area THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate the upload process
3. WHEN multiple images are dropped simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle each image upload individually
4. IF an invalid file is dropped THEN the system SHALL show an error message without disrupting the interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want images to be stored securely in Cloudflare R2, so that we have reliable, scalable, and cost-effective image storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store it in Cloudflare R2 with a unique identifier
2. WHEN storing images THEN the system SHALL generate secure, time-limited access URLs
3. WHEN an image is no longer needed THEN the system SHALL have a mechanism to clean up old images
4. IF R2 storage fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback error handling and user notification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI agent to analyze and interpret my uploaded images, so that I can get meaningful insights and assistance based on visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prompt contains an image THEN the AI agent SHALL receive both the image URL and text prompt
2. WHEN processing an image THEN the agent SHALL be able to describe, analyze, and answer questions about the visual content
3. WHEN responding to image-based prompts THEN the agent SHALL reference specific elements from the image in its response
4. IF image processing fails THEN the agent SHALL inform the user and continue with text-only processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload common image formats, so that I can share screenshots, photos, and graphics without format conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading images THEN the system SHALL support PNG, JPEG, JPG, GIF, and WebP formats
2. WHEN an image exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL compress or reject the image with clear feedback
3. WHEN validating images THEN the system SHALL check for malicious content and reject unsafe files
4. IF an unsupported format is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display supported formats to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage uploaded images in my prompt, so that I can remove, replace, or reorder images before sending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL provide options to remove or replace the image
2. WHEN multiple images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL allow reordering of images
3. WHEN editing a prompt with images THEN the system SHALL maintain image associations with the text
4. WHEN removing an image THEN the system SHALL update the prompt preview immediately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want image uploads to work seamlessly across different devices and browsers, so that all users have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the image upload feature THEN it SHALL work on desktop and mobile browsers
2. WHEN uploading from mobile devices THEN users SHALL be able to access camera and photo library
3. WHEN using different browsers THEN the upload functionality SHALL maintain consistent behavior
4. IF a browser doesn't support certain features THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallbacks
