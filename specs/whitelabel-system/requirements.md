# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the current system into a whitelabel solution, allowing multiple organizations to use the platform with their own branding, custom domains, and isolated data. The whitelabel system will enable the creation of multiple tenant instances while maintaining a single codebase and infrastructure, providing each tenant with a fully customized experience that appears as their own product.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to create and manage multiple tenant organizations, so that I can offer whitelabel services to different clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a new tenant THEN the system SHALL generate a unique tenant identifier and configuration
2. WHEN a tenant is created THEN the system SHALL initialize default branding settings and database isolation
3. WHEN viewing tenant list THEN the system SHALL display all active tenants with their status and configuration summary
4. IF a tenant is deactivated THEN the system SHALL prevent access to that tenant's resources while preserving data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to customize my organization's branding and appearance, so that the platform reflects my company's identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing branding settings THEN the system SHALL allow upload of custom logos, colors, and styling
2. WHEN branding is updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes across all tenant-specific pages immediately
3. WHEN a user visits the tenant's domain THEN the system SHALL display the custom branding consistently
4. IF branding assets are invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the upload and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want to access the platform through my organization's custom domain, so that the experience feels native to my organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom domain is configured THEN the system SHALL route requests to the correct tenant instance
2. WHEN accessing via custom domain THEN the system SHALL display tenant-specific branding and content
3. WHEN SSL is required THEN the system SHALL automatically provision and manage certificates for custom domains
4. IF domain verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for DNS configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want my organization's data to be completely isolated from other tenants, so that privacy and security are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs any operation THEN the system SHALL ensure data access is restricted to their tenant only
2. WHEN querying the database THEN the system SHALL automatically filter results by tenant identifier
3. WHEN creating new records THEN the system SHALL automatically associate them with the correct tenant
4. IF a cross-tenant data access attempt occurs THEN the system SHALL block the operation and log the security event

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to manage user access and permissions within my organization, so that I can control who has access to what features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inviting users THEN the system SHALL restrict invitations to the tenant's domain or approved email list
2. WHEN assigning roles THEN the system SHALL limit role assignments to tenant-specific permissions
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them within their tenant context only
4. IF a user tries to access another tenant THEN the system SHALL deny access and redirect to their tenant

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to configure different feature sets for different tenants, so that I can offer tiered service levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a tenant THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling specific features per tenant
2. WHEN a user accesses a disabled feature THEN the system SHALL hide the feature or show upgrade prompts
3. WHEN feature limits are reached THEN the system SHALL enforce restrictions and notify administrators
4. IF feature configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately without requiring restart

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to configure custom authentication methods, so that users can login using our existing identity systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring SSO THEN the system SHALL support SAML and OAuth2 integration per tenant
2. WHEN users authenticate via SSO THEN the system SHALL map user attributes to tenant-specific roles
3. WHEN SSO is enabled THEN the system SHALL redirect login attempts to the tenant's identity provider
4. IF SSO configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fall back to standard authentication and alert administrators

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to monitor usage and performance across all tenants, so that I can ensure system health and plan capacity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL provide tenant-specific usage metrics and performance data
2. WHEN resource limits are approached THEN the system SHALL alert administrators before limits are exceeded
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL aggregate data while maintaining tenant isolation
4. IF performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL identify which tenant(s) are affected and provide diagnostic information
