# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines an advanced project scaffolding platform that goes beyond traditional "starter kits" to become a living part of the project lifecycle. The platform combines battle-tested concepts from tools like Yeoman, Cookiecutter, and Plop.js with innovative features inspired by Copier for dynamic template updates. The system will support both full project generation and micro-generators for ongoing development tasks, creating a closed-loop system that maintains architectural consistency throughout a project's evolution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate complete project structures from curated templates, so that I can quickly start new projects with proven architectures and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a template from the official library THEN the system SHALL generate a complete project structure with all necessary files and configurations
2. WHEN a project is generated THEN the system SHALL create a manifest file (.gen-spec.yml) linking the project to the template version
3. WHEN generating a project THEN the system SHALL support parameterization allowing users to customize project details (name, database type, authentication method, etc.)
4. IF a template requires additional configuration THEN the system SHALL prompt the user with an interactive questionnaire
5. WHEN project generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of generated files and next steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update my generated project when the source template is updated, so that I can receive security fixes and framework updates automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a template is updated THEN the system SHALL detect projects generated from that template version
2. WHEN applying template updates THEN the system SHALL perform intelligent merging to preserve user customizations
3. IF conflicts arise during update THEN the system SHALL present conflict resolution options to the user
4. WHEN updates are applied THEN the system SHALL update the manifest file with the new template version
5. WHEN an update is available THEN the system SHALL notify users through the platform interface
6. IF a user chooses to skip an update THEN the system SHALL track the skipped version to avoid repeated notifications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working on an existing project, I want to use micro-generators for repetitive tasks, so that I can maintain consistency and save time on boilerplate code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs a micro-generator command THEN the system SHALL execute the generator defined in the project template
2. WHEN micro-generators are available THEN the system SHALL provide a discoverable list of available generators for the current project
3. WHEN executing a micro-generator THEN the system SHALL follow the architectural patterns defined in the project template
4. IF a micro-generator requires parameters THEN the system SHALL prompt for necessary inputs
5. WHEN a micro-generator completes THEN the system SHALL generate files following the project's established conventions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a template creator, I want to publish and maintain templates in a marketplace, so that other developers can benefit from my architectural patterns and I can keep them updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a template THEN the system SHALL provide tools for template definition and testing
2. WHEN publishing a template THEN the system SHALL validate template structure and metadata
3. WHEN a template is published THEN the system SHALL make it discoverable in the marketplace
4. WHEN updating a published template THEN the system SHALL version the changes and notify dependent projects
5. IF a template has dependencies THEN the system SHALL manage and validate dependency compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a team lead or architect, I want to create custom templates for my organization, so that all team members follow consistent architectural patterns and coding standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a custom template THEN the system SHALL support private template repositories
2. WHEN team members generate projects THEN the system SHALL enforce organizational templates and standards
3. WHEN defining templates THEN the system SHALL support inheritance from base templates
4. IF organizational standards change THEN the system SHALL propagate updates to all team projects
5. WHEN onboarding new team members THEN the system SHALL provide access to organizational templates

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the platform to maintain architectural consistency over time, so that my codebase doesn't drift from established patterns as the project evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using micro-generators THEN the system SHALL ensure generated code follows the original template's architectural decisions
2. WHEN template updates include new architectural patterns THEN the system SHALL offer to apply these patterns to existing code
3. IF architectural drift is detected THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for realignment
4. WHEN multiple developers work on a project THEN the system SHALL ensure all generated code follows consistent patterns
5. WHEN reviewing project health THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on architectural consistency

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want a seamless command-line and web interface experience, so that I can efficiently manage templates and projects across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive commands for all major operations
2. WHEN using the web interface THEN the system SHALL offer visual template browsing and project management
3. WHEN switching between interfaces THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent state and functionality
4. IF working offline THEN the system SHALL cache templates and allow basic operations
5. WHEN collaborating with team members THEN the system SHALL support sharing and synchronization of custom templates

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples for templates, so that I can understand and effectively use available scaffolding options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing templates THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive documentation and usage examples
2. WHEN a template is complex THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guides and best practices
3. WHEN learning to create templates THEN the system SHALL offer tutorials and reference documentation
4. IF a template has specific requirements THEN the system SHALL clearly document prerequisites and setup steps
5. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and debugging information
