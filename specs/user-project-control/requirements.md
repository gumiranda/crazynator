# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to have complete control over their generated projects, including environment configuration, library management, file uploads, and project export capabilities. Users will be able to customize their projects beyond the initial generation, manage dependencies, upload assets like images, and download their complete projects as ZIP files whenever needed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure environment variables for my generated project, so that I can customize the project's behavior and integrate with external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses a generated project THEN the system SHALL display an environment configuration interface
2. WHEN a user adds or modifies environment variables THEN the system SHALL validate the variable names and values
3. WHEN a user saves environment changes THEN the system SHALL update the project's .env file
4. IF environment variables contain sensitive data THEN the system SHALL mask the values in the UI
5. WHEN a user views environment variables THEN the system SHALL show both custom and default variables separately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install and manage libraries in my generated project, so that I can add functionality and dependencies as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the library management interface THEN the system SHALL display currently installed packages
2. WHEN a user searches for a library THEN the system SHALL provide search results from npm registry
3. WHEN a user installs a library THEN the system SHALL update package.json and install the dependency
4. WHEN a user removes a library THEN the system SHALL uninstall the package and update package.json
5. WHEN library installation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
6. WHEN a user views installed libraries THEN the system SHALL show version information and update availability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload images and other files to my project, so that I can include custom assets and resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the file upload interface THEN the system SHALL allow drag-and-drop file uploads
2. WHEN a user uploads files THEN the system SHALL validate file types and sizes
3. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store them in the appropriate project directory
4. WHEN a user uploads images THEN the system SHALL provide preview functionality
5. IF file upload fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
6. WHEN a user manages uploaded files THEN the system SHALL allow file deletion and organization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download my complete project as a ZIP file, so that I can work on it locally or create backups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests project download THEN the system SHALL generate a complete ZIP archive
2. WHEN creating the ZIP file THEN the system SHALL include all project files, dependencies, and uploaded assets
3. WHEN the ZIP is ready THEN the system SHALL provide a download link
4. IF ZIP generation fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and retry options
5. WHEN downloading large projects THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
6. WHEN a user downloads a project THEN the system SHALL log the download activity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview and test my project changes in real-time, so that I can see the impact of my modifications immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes changes to the project THEN the system SHALL provide live preview functionality
2. WHEN environment variables are updated THEN the system SHALL restart the preview with new settings
3. WHEN new libraries are installed THEN the system SHALL rebuild the project for preview
4. IF preview fails THEN the system SHALL display build errors and logs
5. WHEN a user uploads assets THEN the system SHALL make them available in the preview immediately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage project settings and metadata, so that I can organize and customize my projects effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses project settings THEN the system SHALL display editable project information
2. WHEN a user updates project name or description THEN the system SHALL save the changes
3. WHEN a user sets project visibility THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate access controls
4. WHEN project settings are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide validation feedback
5. WHEN a user deletes a project THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and clean up all associated data
