# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive project generator for Bun.js applications that automates the creation of backend projects with integrated frontend CRUD operations. Similar to Spring Initializr, this tool will allow developers to quickly scaffold complete full-stack applications with predefined configurations, database integrations, and automatically generated CRUD interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate a new Bun.js backend project with customizable configurations, so that I can quickly start development without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the project generator THEN the system SHALL display a configuration form with project metadata options
2. WHEN a user selects project dependencies THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility and display warnings for conflicts
3. WHEN a user submits the configuration THEN the system SHALL generate a complete Bun.js project structure with all selected dependencies
4. WHEN the project is generated THEN the system SHALL include package.json, tsconfig.json, and environment configuration files
5. IF the user selects database integration THEN the system SHALL include appropriate ORM setup and connection configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically generate CRUD operations for my data models, so that I can have a working API without writing boilerplate code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user defines data models in the generator THEN the system SHALL create corresponding database schemas
2. WHEN CRUD generation is requested THEN the system SHALL generate REST API endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations
3. WHEN API endpoints are generated THEN the system SHALL include proper validation, error handling, and response formatting
4. WHEN database operations are created THEN the system SHALL include transaction support and connection pooling
5. IF the user selects authentication THEN the system SHALL protect CRUD endpoints with appropriate middleware

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an integrated frontend interface for the generated CRUD operations, so that I can immediately test and use the API functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend integration is selected THEN the system SHALL generate a React/Next.js frontend application
2. WHEN CRUD frontend is generated THEN the system SHALL create forms for creating and editing records
3. WHEN data tables are generated THEN the system SHALL include pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities
4. WHEN frontend components are created THEN the system SHALL include proper TypeScript types and API client integration
5. IF real-time features are selected THEN the system SHALL include WebSocket integration for live updates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize the generated project with different database providers and authentication methods, so that I can match my specific requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting database options THEN the system SHALL support PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB
2. WHEN choosing authentication THEN the system SHALL support JWT, OAuth2, and session-based authentication
3. WHEN configuring deployment THEN the system SHALL include Docker configuration and deployment scripts
4. WHEN selecting additional features THEN the system SHALL support file upload, email integration, and caching
5. IF advanced features are selected THEN the system SHALL include rate limiting, logging, and monitoring setup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated project to follow best practices and be production-ready, so that I can deploy it without additional configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is generated THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling and logging configuration
2. WHEN security features are included THEN the system SHALL implement CORS, helmet, and input validation
3. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL follow modular architecture patterns
4. WHEN tests are generated THEN the system SHALL include unit tests and integration tests for CRUD operations
5. IF documentation is requested THEN the system SHALL generate API documentation and README files

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preview and download the generated project, so that I can review the code before using it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a preview of the project structure
2. WHEN previewing code THEN the system SHALL allow browsing through generated files
3. WHEN downloading is requested THEN the system SHALL provide a ZIP file with the complete project
4. WHEN the project is downloaded THEN the system SHALL include setup instructions and getting started guide
5. IF modifications are needed THEN the system SHALL allow regeneration with updated configurations
