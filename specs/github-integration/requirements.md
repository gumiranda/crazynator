# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to seamlessly integrate their projects with GitHub by creating repositories directly from the platform and maintaining synchronization with future commits and pull requests. The integration will provide a bridge between the project development environment and GitHub's version control system, allowing for continuous collaboration and code management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to create a GitHub repository from my existing project, so that I can version control my code and collaborate with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Create GitHub Repository" THEN the system SHALL authenticate with GitHub using OAuth
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL display a form to configure repository settings (name, description, visibility)
3. WHEN the user submits the repository form THEN the system SHALL create a new GitHub repository with the specified settings
4. WHEN the repository is created THEN the system SHALL push the current project files to the new repository
5. IF the repository creation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my local changes to be automatically synchronized with GitHub, so that my repository stays up-to-date without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes changes to project files THEN the system SHALL detect file modifications
2. WHEN changes are detected AND auto-sync is enabled THEN the system SHALL create a commit with the changes
3. WHEN creating a commit THEN the system SHALL generate a meaningful commit message based on the changes
4. WHEN the commit is created THEN the system SHALL push the commit to the connected GitHub repository
5. IF the push fails due to conflicts THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide resolution options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project collaborator, I want to create pull requests directly from the platform, so that I can propose changes for review without leaving the development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has uncommitted changes THEN the system SHALL provide an option to create a pull request
2. WHEN creating a pull request THEN the system SHALL create a new branch with the changes
3. WHEN the branch is created THEN the system SHALL push the branch to GitHub
4. WHEN the branch is pushed THEN the system SHALL create a pull request with title, description, and target branch
5. WHEN the pull request is created THEN the system SHALL display the PR URL and status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to configure GitHub integration settings, so that I can control how my project synchronizes with GitHub.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses integration settings THEN the system SHALL display current GitHub connection status
2. WHEN configuring settings THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling auto-sync
3. WHEN configuring settings THEN the system SHALL allow setting commit message templates
4. WHEN configuring settings THEN the system SHALL allow selecting which file types to sync
5. WHEN settings are saved THEN the system SHALL validate and apply the new configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view the synchronization status and history, so that I can track what changes have been pushed to GitHub.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing sync status THEN the system SHALL display the last sync timestamp
2. WHEN viewing sync history THEN the system SHALL show a list of recent commits with timestamps and messages
3. WHEN viewing sync history THEN the system SHALL indicate successful and failed sync attempts
4. WHEN a sync fails THEN the system SHALL display the error details and suggested actions
5. WHEN viewing status THEN the system SHALL show pending changes that haven't been synced

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to disconnect GitHub integration, so that I can stop synchronization while preserving my existing repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user chooses to disconnect THEN the system SHALL confirm the action with a warning dialog
2. WHEN disconnection is confirmed THEN the system SHALL remove stored GitHub credentials
3. WHEN disconnected THEN the system SHALL stop all automatic synchronization
4. WHEN disconnected THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing GitHub repository unchanged
5. WHEN disconnected THEN the system SHALL allow reconnecting to the same or different repository later
