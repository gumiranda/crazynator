# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides users with intelligent code pattern suggestions and architectural guidance during project development. The system will analyze the user's code and suggest best practices including Atomic Design, Feature-Sliced Design, proper usage of libraries like React Query and Zustand, and other modern development patterns. This helps users write more maintainable, scalable, and well-structured code.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive suggestions for code organization patterns like Atomic Design and Feature-Sliced Design, so that I can structure my components and features in a maintainable way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates React components THEN the system SHALL suggest Atomic Design categorization (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
2. WHEN a user organizes features THEN the system SHALL recommend Feature-Sliced Design structure (shared, entities, features, widgets, pages, app)
3. WHEN components become too complex THEN the system SHALL suggest breaking them into smaller, more focused components
4. IF component hierarchy is deeply nested THEN the system SHALL recommend flattening or restructuring
5. WHEN a user creates similar components THEN the system SHALL suggest creating reusable abstractions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive suggestions for proper state management patterns using Zustand, so that I can manage application state effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user manages local state THEN the system SHALL suggest when to use Zustand for global state
2. WHEN creating Zustand stores THEN the system SHALL recommend proper store structure and slicing
3. WHEN state becomes complex THEN the system SHALL suggest separating concerns into multiple stores
4. IF state mutations are detected THEN the system SHALL recommend immutable update patterns
5. WHEN using derived state THEN the system SHALL suggest proper selector patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive suggestions for data fetching patterns using React Query, so that I can handle server state efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes API calls THEN the system SHALL suggest using React Query for server state management
2. WHEN implementing data fetching THEN the system SHALL recommend proper query key structures
3. WHEN handling mutations THEN the system SHALL suggest optimistic updates and cache invalidation patterns
4. IF loading states are missing THEN the system SHALL recommend proper loading and error handling
5. WHEN data is refetched frequently THEN the system SHALL suggest caching and stale-time configurations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive suggestions for TypeScript best practices, so that I can write type-safe and maintainable code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using TypeScript THEN the system SHALL suggest proper type definitions and interfaces
2. WHEN creating generic components THEN the system SHALL recommend appropriate generic constraints
3. IF any types are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest more specific type definitions
4. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL recommend proper type validation
5. WHEN creating utility types THEN the system SHALL suggest built-in TypeScript utilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive suggestions for performance optimization patterns, so that I can build efficient applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components re-render frequently THEN the system SHALL suggest React.memo, useMemo, or useCallback optimizations
2. WHEN handling large lists THEN the system SHALL recommend virtualization techniques
3. IF bundle size is large THEN the system SHALL suggest code splitting and lazy loading
4. WHEN images are used THEN the system SHALL recommend optimization and lazy loading patterns
5. WHEN expensive operations are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest moving them to web workers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive suggestions for testing patterns and best practices, so that I can write comprehensive and maintainable tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate testing strategies
2. WHEN custom hooks are implemented THEN the system SHALL recommend testing patterns for hooks
3. IF test coverage is low THEN the system SHALL suggest areas that need testing
4. WHEN testing async operations THEN the system SHALL recommend proper async testing patterns
5. WHEN mocking is needed THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate mocking strategies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive suggestions for accessibility patterns, so that I can build inclusive applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating interactive elements THEN the system SHALL suggest proper ARIA attributes
2. WHEN building forms THEN the system SHALL recommend accessibility best practices
3. IF color contrast is insufficient THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements
4. WHEN using custom components THEN the system SHALL recommend keyboard navigation support
5. WHEN images are used THEN the system SHALL suggest proper alt text patterns

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive contextual suggestions based on my current code, so that I can get relevant recommendations while coding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is actively coding THEN the system SHALL analyze the current context and provide relevant suggestions
2. WHEN patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements or alternatives
3. IF anti-patterns are found THEN the system SHALL recommend better approaches
4. WHEN libraries are used incorrectly THEN the system SHALL suggest proper usage patterns
5. WHEN code quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide actionable improvement suggestions
