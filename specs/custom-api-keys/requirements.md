# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will allow users to configure their own API keys for OpenAI and Anthropic services, giving them control over their AI model usage and costs. Users will be able to input their API keys, select from available models, and manage their own AI service consumption directly through the application interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input my own OpenAI API key, so that I can use my own OpenAI account and control my usage costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the settings page THEN the system SHALL display an input field for OpenAI API key
2. WHEN a user enters a valid OpenAI API key THEN the system SHALL validate the key format and store it securely
3. WHEN a user enters an invalid OpenAI API key THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user saves their OpenAI API key THEN the system SHALL encrypt and store the key in the database
5. WHEN a user has configured their OpenAI API key THEN the system SHALL use this key for all OpenAI API calls instead of the default system key

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input my own Anthropic API key, so that I can use my own Anthropic account and control my usage costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the settings page THEN the system SHALL display an input field for Anthropic API key
2. WHEN a user enters a valid Anthropic API key THEN the system SHALL validate the key format and store it securely
3. WHEN a user enters an invalid Anthropic API key THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user saves their Anthropic API key THEN the system SHALL encrypt and store the key in the database
5. WHEN a user has configured their Anthropic API key THEN the system SHALL use this key for all Anthropic API calls instead of the default system key

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select which AI model to use, so that I can choose the model that best fits my needs and budget.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has configured an OpenAI API key THEN the system SHALL display available OpenAI models for selection
2. WHEN a user has configured an Anthropic API key THEN the system SHALL display available Anthropic models for selection
3. WHEN a user selects a model THEN the system SHALL save this preference and use it for future AI interactions
4. WHEN a user has not configured any API keys THEN the system SHALL use the default system configuration
5. WHEN a user changes their selected model THEN the system SHALL apply the change to subsequent AI interactions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my API key settings, so that I can update or remove my keys when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their API key settings THEN the system SHALL display masked versions of their stored keys
2. WHEN a user wants to update an API key THEN the system SHALL allow them to enter a new key and validate it
3. WHEN a user wants to remove an API key THEN the system SHALL allow them to delete the key and revert to system defaults
4. WHEN a user removes an API key THEN the system SHALL securely delete the key from storage
5. WHEN a user has removed all custom API keys THEN the system SHALL fall back to using system default keys

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my API keys to be stored securely, so that my credentials are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters an API key THEN the system SHALL encrypt the key before storing it in the database
2. WHEN the system needs to use an API key THEN it SHALL decrypt the key only in memory for the duration of the API call
3. WHEN displaying API keys in the UI THEN the system SHALL show only masked versions (e.g., "sk-...xyz123")
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL not cache decrypted API keys
5. IF there is a security breach THEN the stored API keys SHALL remain encrypted and unusable without the decryption key

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see which model I'm currently using, so that I can understand what AI service is processing my requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is interacting with the AI THEN the system SHALL display which model is currently being used
2. WHEN a user switches between different configured models THEN the system SHALL update the display to show the active model
3. WHEN a user has multiple API keys configured THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which service provider and model is active
4. WHEN a user is using system default keys THEN the system SHALL indicate this in the model display
5. WHEN an AI response is generated THEN the system SHALL include metadata about which model was used
